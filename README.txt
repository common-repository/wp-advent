Enables advent calendars on your WordPress blog.

== Description ==
With this plugin you can create a advent calendar on your WP site.

It is using shortcodes, so it is possible to add the calendar to a regular post, a page or any other post type.

Multiple calendars and calendar years are supported.

We have a public git repository at [https://github.com/lostfocus/wp-advent](https://github.com/lostfocus/wp-advent) and we're happy to answer to questions here and there.
Pull requests are obviously also very welcome.

== Changelog ==
= 1.3.4 =
Fixed a bug where calendar sheets have a random slideshow function, also updated Glightbox to the new stable version.

= 1.3.3 =
We've added a whole bunch of new HTML classes and ids so you have more control over the styling of your calendar.
We also added a new "black/white" option that always sets the calendar sheet background to a white color and the calendar sheet
font to a black one, which is necessary with some themes, especially the official and still popular Twenty Sixteen theme.


= 1.3.2 =
We're now loading all theme CSS files and add a few more classes to style the calendar.

= 1.3.1 =
Fixed some smaller CSS issues.

= 1.3 =
Changed the lightbox script to [glightbox](https://github.com/mcstudios/glightbox)
The plugin uses your theme CSS to style the entries now

Fixed a bug where calendar sheets appear erroneously in search results.

Bugfix.

= 1.2 =
The plugin is now ready for WordPress 4.4.
And once your WordPress is updated, you'll be able to shuffle the calendars to make them a little bit more exciting.

= 1.1.2 =
Apparently there were two bugs that made it look like sheets were "lost." This update should fix the second bug, too.

= 1.1 =
Cleaned up the interface.

There was a bug in an older version of this plugin that prevented some sheets from being attached to a calendar.
We fixed that bug and added a way to attach these "lost" sheets to a calendar.
